1. Sentence Smash - Rank 8
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
```
Examples:
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
```

2. Square(n) Sum Rank 8
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.
```
Examples:  for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9  

```

3. Reversed Strings
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
```
Examples:
'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'
```

4. Is it a palindrome?
Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.


5. Invert values
iven a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.
```
Examples:
invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
```
